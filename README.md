PCSS Mini Project 


This is a networking program you begin it by setting up the server and then you can connect the clients (You can change how many in the code) the default is 5 though. When clients connect they can thoose their own username without anyone seeing what it is. When a client writes something everyone else see their username followed by their message. The sender only sees his/her message.
